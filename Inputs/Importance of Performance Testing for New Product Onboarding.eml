Dear Wihanga Anupama,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention an
important aspect regarding the onboarding of our new product, which I
believe requires our immediate consideration.

As we prepare to onboard the new product, we anticipate a significant
increase in the size and complexity of our application. While this presents
exciting opportunities for growth and innovation, it also brings along
potential challenges, particularly concerning the performance of our
application.

Without thorough performance testing, there is a risk of encountering
service disruptions or even loss on our application. This could result in
significant inconvenience for our users and potential reputational damage
for our organization. Given the importance of maintaining a seamless user
experience and ensuring the reliability of our services, it is imperative
that we prioritize performance testing as a crucial step in our onboarding
process.

To mitigate these risks effectively, I propose that we allocate sufficient
resources and time to conduct comprehensive performance testing for the new
product. This will allow us to identify any potential bottlenecks or issues
early on, enabling us to address them proactively and ensure a smooth
transition for our users.

I would appreciate your support in highlighting the importance of
performance testing to our stakeholders and securing the necessary
resources for this endeavor. Together, I am confident that we can
successfully navigate this phase of onboarding and deliver an exceptional
experience for our users.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and please don't hesitate to
reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,
Wihanga Anupama
